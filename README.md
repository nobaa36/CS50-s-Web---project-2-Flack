Python and JavaScript talks thanks to Socket.IO
Application.py contain server side code which listen and emits some data to client
script.js contain client side code changing and shaping look of website
styles.css contain only a few lines of styling, bootstrap4 do the rest
index.html contain structure of website

My personal touch is supporting private messaging between two users.
